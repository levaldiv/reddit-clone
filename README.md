# Responsive Reddit Clone Challenge

How's it going everyone! This here is a Responsive Reddit Clone Challenge! I was tasked to create a semi-clone of the Reddit website with a responsive design (works on lg, md, sm devices). This was definitely another challeging YET exciting build as it focused on TypeScript, SQL, Supabase, GraphQL, and StepZen.

<!-- **NOTE:** This uses test data, so no credit info is needed as it is provided with Stripe.

**NOTE:** This utilizes the Reddits user Login information.


## Main Functionalities

- Responsive (works well with mobile, medium and large devices)
- Created a GraphQL backend that directly connects to my PostgreSQL Supabase database
- Built a login authentication flow with the Reddit API using NextAuth
- Implented my FIRST SQL relational database (including how to use Primary and Foreign Keys)
- Wrote robust code with Typescript
- Leveraged Next.js Server Side Rendering to get a faster page load time
- Created my own API backend endpoints to safely communicate with my frontend
- With all that .. I hope you enjoy!
